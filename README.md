	I tried to run the copy I had (from 3 months previous), and was not entirely surprised that it did not work (and it was not updated either). The precise error was that once it loaded the melon JS Screen, it was stuck there. So I deleted and recloned.
	Unfortunately, the cloned project did not work either. I will stop being lazy and try to debug what is going on in the project.

	1) Added a start_server.sh script since I was too lazy for various reasons, and I keep messing it up somehow.
